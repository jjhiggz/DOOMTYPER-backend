## DOOMTYPER
this repository serves as the backend API feeding to the DOOMTYPER application. 
In order to start this backend on your computer, please run the following command
```
rails s -p 9000
```

For now this backend seeds data manually, and outputs json objects that represent lists of words per topic that feed the typing application
